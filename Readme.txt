You have to create a project and add all the files:
-Text files
-Cpp/Header files

Read data from the 12 Data Sets File given to us along the project. After reading the files we were required to create multiples B+Tree that stored different type of data such as Roll No b+tree stored the Roll not along with the name of File and the line on which we can find the Roll No. After making multiple B+Tree we were required to make cases/queries to run our B+Tree with these queries consisted of searching the B+tree and fetching correspondent data.
